# Mindr

Note Taking Application

## For Framework JS module

We implemented a web application thanks to PWA in flutter.
You can check the visual by running the following command:

`flutter run -d chrome`

Mindr is a note-taking application that is designed to add vocal quick notes and to interact with them.

Our application is using the following plugins **which aren't supporting web yet :**

* https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite

* https://pub.dev/packages/speech_to_text

* https://pub.dev/packages/search_widget

Once the owner of the plugins update them for flutter 2.0 which is the latest version of flutter, our application will be fully viable for web too.
